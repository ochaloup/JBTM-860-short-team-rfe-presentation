Supported from EAP7 where JBTM-860 was fixed ({@link org.jboss.tm.XAResourceWrapper} was implemented)

For EAP6 simulation of similar behavior was possible only with JTA by setting `-DJTAEnvironmentBean.xaAssumeRecoveryComplete=true`
 (details at Narayana recovery guide)

  * Assumed Complete: http://goo.gl/JXsxzY
  * discussion at https://developer.jboss.org/message/902716#902716)

Implementation note:

there exist a `com.arjuna.ats.internal.arjuna.recovery.ExpiredEntryMonitor`
checked by `ExpiryScanner` which is checking long lived log records in txn object store
and could mark such as assumed complete and remove them from the store.
By default scanner runs once per hour.


From Narayana documentation:

Assumed complete

If a failure occurs in the transaction environment after the transaction coordinator had told
the XAResource to commit but before the transaction log has been updated to remove the participant,
then recovery will attempt to replay the commit. In the case of a Serialized XAResource,
the response from the XAResource will enable the participant to be removed from the log,
which will eventually be deleted when all participants have been committed. However,
if the XAResource is not recoverable then it is extremely unlikely that any XAResourceRecovery instance
will be able to provide the recovery sub-system with a fresh XAResource to use in order to attempt recovery;
in which case recovery will continually fail and the log entry will never be removed.

There are two possible solutions to this problem:

* Rely on the relevant `ExpiryScanner` to eventually move the log elsewhere. Manual intervention
  will then be needed to ensure the log can be safely deleted. If a log entry is moved,
  suitable warning messages will be output.
* Set the `com.arjuna.ats.jta.xaAssumeRecoveryComplete` to `true`. This option is checked
  whenever a new XAResource instance cannot be located from any registered `XAResourceRecovery` instance.
  If false (the default), recovery assumes that there is a transient problem
  with the `XAResourceRecovery` instances (e.g., not all have been registered with the sub-system)
  and will attempt recovery periodically. If true then recovery assumes that a previous commit attempt succeeded
  and this instance can be removed from the log with no further recovery attempts.
  This option is global, so needs to be used with care since if used incorrectly `XAResource` instances
  may remain in an uncommitted state.

== use XAResourceWrapper metadata for assume complete?

check logs under directory `logs/`

== Old days (=< EAP6.x)

* wait for `ExpiryScanner`
* set `JTAEnvironmentBean.xaAssumeRecoveryComplete=true`

The operation of the recovery subsystem causes some entries to be made in the ObjectStore
that are not removed in normal progress. The RecoveryManager has a facility for scanning
for these and removing items that are very old. Scans and removals are performed by implementations
of the `com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.recovery.ExpiryScanner`. The RecoveryManager calls the scan method
on each loaded `ExpiryScanner` implementation at an interval determined by the property
`RecoveryEnvironmentBean.expiryScanInterval` . This value is given in hours, and defaults to `12` .

== Nowadays

Resolved automatically for resources which implements `org.jboss.tm.XAResourceWrapper`
where `getJndiName()` matches jndi saved in `Xid`

[NOTE.speaker]

Limitation:

* third party messaging RMs does not implement the wrapper and that way not support
  this automatic resolution
